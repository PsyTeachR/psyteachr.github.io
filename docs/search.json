Making an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. We’ll cover setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.\nBook/Code – this will update regularly before sessions to show what we intend to cover, and after sessions to document what we did actually cover.\nYou will need only very basic R skills and a willingness to learn. The only people this would not be suitable for are those with zero previous experience in R (unless you know you pick up coding languages quickly). If you can install packages and understand the following code, you should be fine:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = 1:10,\n  name = LETTERS[1:10],\n  score = rnorm(10, mean = 100, sd = 10)\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = name, y = score)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nR Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan\nusethis\ntestthat\npkgdown\n\nThe schedule below is only indicative. Coding club is much less formal than a class, so the tasks might move around depending on the skill and interests of the attendees.\n\n\n1. Setting up\n(2022-10-05)\nCreate a package project and edit the default files. We’ll start using the most helpful package, usethis.\n\n\n2. Adding Data\n(2022-10-12)\nAdd datasets to your package and document them with a codebook. You can use our demo data or your own.\n\n\n3. Custom Functions\n(2022-10-19)\nLearn to write custom functions and include them in your package.\n\n\n4. Documentation\n(2022-10-26)\nWrite function documentation using the roxygen format. This is what creates the help documentation for functions.\n\n\n5. Analysis Vignette\n(2022-11-02)\nInclude your study analysis code as a package vignette.\n\n\n6. Pkgdown Websites\n(2022-11-09)\nCreate a package website using pkgdown.\n\n\n7. Unit Tests\n(2022-11-16)\nWrite unit tests for your custom functions using testthat.\n\n\n8. Package Maintenance\n(2022-11-22)\nHow to run CMD-check to make sure everything is put together right, and how to troubleshoot the inevitable problems.\n\n\n9. Sharing your package\n(2022-11-30)\nSet up a github account and make a package repository to share your package and pkgdown website.\n\n\n10. Next steps\n(2022-12-07)\nWhatever we didn’t get to. We’ll also discuss how to continue your learning."

We learned a lot about debugging.\nThe video ends with an unresolved bug. The resolution is to make sure that input$unif_submit is definitely an integer when you add it to the data table. I really don’t know why this fixes it. So the relevant code in the observeEvent() function for unif_submit should be:\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n    x = x,\n    sample = as.integer(input$unif_submit),\n    n = input$unif_n,\n    min = input$unif_min,\n    max = input$unif_max\n)\n\nTo do:\n\nUpdate the norm and binomial functions to display multiple plots\nMake your ggplots prettier\nMake it handle plots with different parameters well. You can either give all facets the same values, or set the axes to vary by facet (or you can give users the option to choose which)\nThink about how you’d want to visualise these distributions and create your own interface options\n\nResources:\n\nsession recording (contact Lisa for the password)\nzip file with the code for our progress"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Seminar given by Phil McAleer to the University of Newcastle, School of Psychology, on Thursday 27th February 2023.\nIn response to the Replication Crisis, recent years have seen a notable increase in the number of researchers taking steps to make their work more open and reproducible. However, whilst individuals can readily improve their own and lab practice, they are often limited in what they can do in the larger field simply by not being at the proverbial table. One area however where we, as lecturers, can readily have an influence is in the postgraduate and undergraduate classes we teach and the students that we interact with. As such, at Glasgow, based on the noted issues and reflecting on the necessary skills sought in a graduate researcher, we have rebuilt our research curriculum to centre on reproducible methods with a focus on teaching traditionally overlooked skills, such as data wrangling, visualisation, and dynamic reproducible report writing. These developments have partly been made possible through a change of analytical software from SPSS to R (with all our materials available here: https://psyteachr.github.io/), but fundamental to the approach has been the focus on the skills taught and not simply a change of software. In addition, we have promoted a focus on the importance of the research question and the hypothesis, as opposed to the outcome, by using assignments based on pre-registration and Registered Reports, as well as assessments discussing the benefits and limitations of open science practices, aiming to develop a more holistic view of the issues within our students. Through honest discussions of different approaches and through developing a diverse skillset, we have looked to build a cohort that knows how research should be conducted, can discuss the reasoning behind those ideas, and has the skillset to implement that approach. That said, these developments have not been without issue and, throughout this talk, as well as highlighting what we have implemented and why, I will also discuss what has not worked and present advice on common implementation challenges, ranging from staff training to building an inclusive and supportive student community. In brief, I will share the rationale and reflections behind our approach to developing students as accountable practitioners of reproducible research with the hope that our experiences can be of benefit to others considering similar changes."

These options not only look attractive, but can increase transparency about the distribution of the underlying data rather than relying on commonly used visualisations of aggregations such as bar charts of means.\nIn this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to data visualisation using R and RStudio, specifically aimed at researchers who have little to no prior experience of using R. First, we provide a brief overview of general data visualisation principles and the ggplot2 package for data visualisation. The workshop then walks you through three different types of plots: bar charts, scatterplots, and. violin-boxplots (with lineplots as a bonus extra)."

However, this increased focus on writing code hasn’t been matched by an increased focus on assessing code, either informally within research teams or formally during the review process. A recent survey suggests that people don’t arrange for their code to be reviewed because there is a lack of time, it’s not seen as a priority, there are not enough colleagues with the appropriate expertise, or they are embarrassed for others see their code. In this talk, I’ll summarise the work of a group of researchers developing a code review guide for beginners. I’ll cover the goals of code check, explain some key concepts, and present checklists for both code reviewers and code writers to get their code in shape for review."

While quarto integrates very easily with R and python to create code-focussed textbooks, you can also use it to publish any type of text.\nThis workshop will use an in-development R package booktem to make setting up a textbook very straightforward. You will just need to install R, RStudio, and quarto on your machine (or use the free service posit.cloud) to participate, but need absolutely no other experience with R. By the end of the workshop, you will have the bones of a textbook, with chapters, appendices, and linked references. If you have a GitHub or GitLab account, you will also be able to put this online. Additionally, we will discuss getting credit for your textbook by registering a DOI with Zenodo and how to set up a textbook in languages other than English."
