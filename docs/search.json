    "text": "Lisa DeBruine was invited to give a talk and workshop on data simulation at the European Evolutionary Biology Conference in Millport, Scotland.\n\nAbstract\nBeing able to simulate data allows you to prep analysis scripts for pre-registration, calculate power and sensitivity for analyses that don’t have empirical methods, create reproducible examples when your data are too big or confidential to share, enhance your understanding of statistical concepts, and create demo data for teaching and tutorials. This workshop will cover the basics of simulation using the R package {faux}. We will simulate data with factorial designs by specifying the within and between-subjects factor structure, each cell mean and standard deviation, and correlations between cells where appropriate. This can be used to create simulated data sets to be used in preparing the analysis code for pre-registrations or registered reports. We will also create data sets for simulation-based power analyses."

However, this increased focus on writing code hasn’t been matched by an increased focus on assessing code, either informally within research teams or formally during the review process. A recent survey suggests that people don’t arrange for their code to be reviewed because there is a lack of time, it’s not seen as a priority, there are not enough colleagues with the appropriate expertise, or they are embarrassed for others see their code. In this talk, I’ll summarise the work of a group of researchers developing a code review guide for beginners. I’ll cover the goals of code check, explain some key concepts, and present checklists for both code reviewers and code writers to get their code in shape for review."

    "text": "Lisa DeBruine and Helena Paterson will be running a workshop on Creating Open Source Textbooks at the 2023 Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science.\n\nAbstract\nOne great way to contribute to open research is by creating your own open-source textbook. In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that you can use to create dynamic online textbooks. While quarto integrates very easily with R and python to create code-focussed textbooks, you can also use it to publish any type of text.\nThis workshop will use an in-development R package booktome to make setting up a textbook very straightforward. You will just need to install R, RStudio, and quarto on your machine (or use the free service posit.cloud) to participate, but need absolutely no other experience with R. By the end of the workshop, you will have the bones of a textbook, with chapters, appendices, and linked references. If you have a GitHub or GitLab account, you will also be able to put this online. Additionally, we will discuss getting credit for your textbook by registering a DOI with Zenodo and how to set up a textbook in languages other than English."
