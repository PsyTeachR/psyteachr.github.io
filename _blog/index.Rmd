The psyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow [School of Psychology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) and [Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/) has successfully made the transition to teaching reproducible research using R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Our curriculum now emphasizes essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports. Students learn about probability and inference through data simulation as well as by working with real datasets.

This website contains our open materials for teaching reproducible research.

#### [Level 2: Analysis](/analysis/)

Our second-year undergraduate course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as permutation tests, NHST, alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. Semester 2 focusses on correlations and the general linear model.

#### [Data Skills for Reproducible Research](/reprores/)

This book provides an overview of skills needed for reproducible research and open science using the statistical programming language R and tidyverse packages. It covers data visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and functions, probability and data simulations, general linear models, and reproducible workflows. It assumes at least an undergraduate level of methods training, but no prior experience in R.
