      <description>The PsyTeachR team gave a workshop at the 2019 meeting of the Society for the Improvement on Psychological Science. See our materials here.
Abstract At Glasgow our PsyTeachR teaching team has successfully made the transition to teaching R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In this workshop we will share our experiences, insights, and teaching materials. Our curriculum now emphasises certain essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports.</description>
