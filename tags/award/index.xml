      <description>Congratulations to the PsyTeachR team who recently received a College of Science &amp;amp; Engineering Teaching Excellence Award for their submission PsyTeachR: Teaching Reproducible Data Analysis.
The award was presented by Professor John Davies, Dean of Learning &amp;amp; Teaching, at graduation prize giving in the Wolfson Medical Building on Wednesday 25 June.
The College panel was impressed by several aspects of the nomination, including the clear underlying principles which guided its implementation, the co-creation of material with students, and the workshop, which shared experiences, insights, and teaching materials with academic staff from other institutions.</description>
