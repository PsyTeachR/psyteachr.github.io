<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Arguably, one of the most effective ways in which to enable researchers to adopt open and reproducible research practices is to introduce the underlying computational skills needed to create reproducible workflows early on in the researchers&rsquo; training.  Traditionally, undergraduate degree programmes in science and social sciences provide students with key skills in research methods and statistical modelling. By teaching these skills via open and reproducible statistical programming languages such as R, students develop the ability to engage in reproducible research practices alongside acquiring the underlying conceptual knowledge in statistics, coding, and research design.  These skills are also valuable in terms of future employability. The University of Glasgow has led the way in terms of the large-scale introduction of R and Reproducibility to undergraduate Psychology students from the very first semester of their first year. Other Universities are now following suit.</p>
<p>In this workshop we will talk about our personal experiences of introducing reproducible research practices in UG and PGT curricula including the challenges that can occur at an institutional level that require risks to be taken, the challenges around colleagues needing to learn a new set of skills in order to supervise reproducible dissertations, pedagogical issues around introducing coding, and practical challenges around teaching groups of students using software that they may need to install locally.</p>
