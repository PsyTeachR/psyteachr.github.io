Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Gilbert et al., 2016) coupled with the British Academy (2012,2016) report revealing that UK undergraduate students have reduced quantitative ability in comparison to international counterparts, has led to numerous calls for action.  One such call emphasized the need to make improvements at a grassroots level by revising undergraduate training in psychology (Button, 2018).  Within this talk I will discuss how as a discipline we can collectively answer this call by supporting our future psychologists in becoming more intelligent ‘consumers of science’ (Diener \u0026 Biwas-Diener, 2016). In uncertain times of rapid change, within HE and the wider national and global political context, achieving this aim is not without challenges. I will suggest that collaboration and cooperation across the discipline will be essential in rising to these challenges.","tags":["collaboration","pedagogy","reproducibility","BPS"],"title":"Transforming Teaching in Tricky Times","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"5e5da0bd1e50ad86fa388e03b8b80586","permalink":"/project/book-template/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/book-template/","section":"project","summary":"A quick start guide for the specific bookdown templates we're using at UofG Psychology, plus a style guide and inclusion guidelines for open science materials.","tags":["R","teaching","bookdown"],"title":"Course Book Template","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Further Info\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"256f7fb14353076e5ab4b7631b8553af","permalink":"/talk/2019_hackdata/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_hackdata/","section":"talk","summary":"Coding is a skill that can be picked up by people from all backgrounds, for any kind of data.

For example, analyses show that many published results cannot be replicated in new samples and generalise poorly to new populations.

I will focus on my lab’s experience conducting a preregistered study through the Psychological Science Accelerator, a globally distributed network of \u0026gt;350 laboratories from \u0026gt;45 countries.\nDo Psychological Effects Vary across Sample and Setting? Findings from Many Labs 2 Richard Klein This talk presents results from Many Labs 2, a recent large-scale project in which 28 psychological effects were replicated across 125 samples from 36 countries (N = 15,305). This talk will emphasize whether replication effect size varies based on the specific sample or setting of data collection.\nTeaching Open Science Niamh Stack To address recent concerns about the reliability of psychological findings, some have emphasized the need to improve training at a grassroots level (cf. Button et al., 2016). This talk discusses how we can answer this call by supporting undergraduates in becoming more intelligent ‘consumers of science’ (Diener \u0026amp; Biwas-Diener, 2016).\nWriting Reproducible Manuscripts Lisa DeBruine Perhaps half of published psychology papers contain at least one inconsistent statistic (e.g., Nuijten et al, 2016). I will discuss methods for reproducible manuscripts that reduce transcription errors and act as self-documentation of data and analysis. These techniques promote open science and make it easier to meet new journal requirements.\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"123c61bd8cecdafe1d06e71287bfaac6","permalink":"/talk/2019_icps/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_icps/","section":"talk","summary":"Open science reforms may be seen as added barriers to research.
