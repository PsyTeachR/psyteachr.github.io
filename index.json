Everyone can be a data scientist! Coding skills provide tools to enhance communicating your data and ideas to a wide range of audiences and disciplines. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to make your own website or to visualise your data in a way that is engaging and rigorous, coding is for you. In addition, showcasing your findings in new ways may help you look at your data from a different perspective and lead to a deeper understanding of data.","tags":["R","postgraduate","tutorial","dataviz"],"title":"Hack Your Data Beautiful","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Rick Klein","Benedict Jones","Niamh Stack","Lisa DeBruine"],"categories":null,"content":" Crowdsourcing Psychological Science Benedict Jones Crowdsourcing presents a solution to problems of low power and lack of diversity in research samples that often undermine conclusions from psychological research. I will focus on my lab’s experience conducting a preregistered study through the Psychological Science Accelerator, a globally distributed network of \u0026gt;350 laboratories from \u0026gt;45 countries.\nDo Psychological Effects Vary across Sample and Setting? Findings from Many Labs 2 Richard Klein This talk presents results from Many Labs 2, a recent large-scale project in which 28 psychological effects were replicated across 125 samples from 36 countries (N = 15,305). This talk will emphasize whether replication effect size varies based on the specific sample or setting of data collection.\nTeaching Open Science Niamh Stack To address recent concerns about the reliability of psychological findings, some have emphasized the need to improve training at a grassroots level (cf. Button et al., 2016). This talk discusses how we can answer this call by supporting undergraduates in becoming more intelligent ‘consumers of science’ (Diener \u0026amp; Biwas-Diener, 2016).\nWriting Reproducible Manuscripts Lisa DeBruine Perhaps half of published psychology papers contain at least one inconsistent statistic (e.g., Nuijten et al, 2016). I will discuss methods for reproducible manuscripts that reduce transcription errors and act as self-documentation of data and analysis. These techniques promote open science and make it easier to meet new journal requirements.\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"123c61bd8cecdafe1d06e71287bfaac6","permalink":"https://psyteachr.github.io/talk/2019_icps/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_icps/","section":"talk","summary":"Open science reforms may be seen as added barriers to research.
