      <description>The PsyTeachR team gave a workshop at the 2019 meeting of the Society for the Improvement on Psychological Science. See our materials here.
Abstract At Glasgow our PsyTeachR teaching team has successfully made the transition to teaching R across all undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In this workshop we will share our experiences, insights, and teaching materials. Our curriculum now emphasises certain essential ‘data science’ graduate skills that have been overlooked in traditional approaches to teaching, including programming skills, data visualisation, data wrangling and reproducible reports.</description>

Abstract Coding is a skill that can be picked up by people from all backgrounds, for any kind of data. Everyone can be a data scientist! Coding skills provide tools to enhance communicating your data and ideas to a wide range of audiences and disciplines. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to make your own website or to visualise your data in a way that is engaging and rigorous, coding is for you.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to the PsyTeachR team who recently received a College of Science &amp;amp; Engineering Teaching Excellence Award for their submission PsyTeachR: Teaching Reproducible Data Analysis.
The award was presented by Professor John Davies, Dean of Learning &amp;amp; Teaching, at graduation prize giving in the Wolfson Medical Building on Wednesday 25 June.
The College panel was impressed by several aspects of the nomination, including the clear underlying principles which guided its implementation, the co-creation of material with students, and the workshop, which shared experiences, insights, and teaching materials with academic staff from other institutions.</description>
