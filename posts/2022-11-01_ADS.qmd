Have you been meaning to learn R, but need some structure to help motivate you and get over the initial steep learning curve?

Emily Nordmann and Lisa DeBruine are offering a 10-week microcredential course on "Applied Data Skills for Processing and Presenting Data", starting January 24, 2023!

It’s a paid course (£799) for course credits (if you complete the assessment) or a CPD certificate. There are also some fully funded places for Scottish-domiciled learners.
