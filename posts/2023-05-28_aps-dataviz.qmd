Emily Nordmann was invited by the Association for Psychological Science to give a [workshop at the 2023 APS Conference](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions/2023-aps-annual-convention/2023-workshops) introducing researchers who don't use R to data visualisation using ggplot2. (Unfortunately, air travel problems meant this was cancelled.)

### Abstract

This workshop will provide a pragmatic introduction to the programming language R through focusing on data visualization using materials adapted from the PsyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow. No prior knowledge of R or programming is required.
