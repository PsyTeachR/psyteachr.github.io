Justify Everything (Or: Why All Norms You Rely on When Doing Research Are Wrong) <a href="https://osf.io/j4s3c/">(slides)</a> <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Science is difficult. To do good science researchers need to know about philosophy of science, learn how to develop theories, become experts in experimental design, study measurement theory, understand the statistics they require to analyze their data, and clearly communicate their results. My personal goal is to become good enough in all these areas such that I will be able to complete a single flawless experiment, just before I retire – but I expect to fail. In the meantime, I often need to rely on social norms when I make choices as I perform research. From the way I phrase my research question, to how I determine the sample size for a study, or my decision for a one or two-sided test, my justifications are typically ‘this is how we do it’. If you ask me ‘why’ I often don’t know the answer. In this talk I will explain that, regrettably, almost all the norms we rely on are wrong. I will provide some suggestions for attempts to justify aspects of the research cycle that I am somewhat knowledgeable in, mainly in the area of statistics and experimental design. I will discuss the (im)possibility of individually accumulating sufficient knowledge to actually be able to justify all important decisions in the research you do, and make some tentative predictions that in half a century most scientific disciplines will have become massively more collaborative, with a stronger task division between scholars working on joint projects.

The art and science of teaching data science <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Modern statistics is fundamentally a computational discipline, but too often this fact is not reflected in our statistics curricula. With the rise of data science it has become increasingly clear that students want, expect, and need explicit training in this area of the discipline. Additionally, recent curricular guidelines clearly state that working with data requires extensive computing skills and that statistics students should be fluent in accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and modeling with professional statistical analysis software. In this talk, we introduce the design philosophy behind an introductory data science course, discuss in progress and future research on student learning as well as new directions in assessment and tooling as we scale up the course.

Eavesdropping On Everyday Life <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>
This talk considers the unique insights that can be gained by combining multiple methods for studying daily life. In the Personality and Interpersonal Roles Study (PAIRS), 300 participants completed experience sampling method (ESM) self-reports while wearing the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an unobtrusive audio recording device, for one week. Over the past five years, nearly 300 research assistants have transcribed and coded participants’ behaviors and environments from over 300,000 EAR audio files. To provide two examples of questions that can only be answered by capturing actual behavior alongside ESM self-reports, I will describe two projects that have resulted from this dataset: 1) Do people have self-knowledge of their momentary personality states, and 2) What are people doing when they miss experience sampling reports? I will conclude by discussing the opportunities and challenges of implementing open practices with this highly-identifiable and repeatedly-used dataset.

Tools for reproducible fMRI analysis <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>On our way to transparent and reproducible neuroimaging we need to consider data and code in combination with the publication. In this talk, I will introduce a series of tools that the field has developed (BIDS, Heudiconv, MRIQC, MRIQCeption, fMRIprep, OpenNeuro, NeuroVault) that will not only help to achieve this goal of fully reproducible neuroimaging but also make a neuroimagers life easier.</p>
Note: while the tools are focussed on neuroimaging the principle holds for behavioural, eye-tracking and physiological measures (e.g., BIDS is applicable to these measures).

How to obtain evidence for the null hypothesis <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245919876960">(paper)</a> <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
To get evidence for or against one’s theory relative to the null hypothesis, one needs to know what it predicts. The amount of evidence can then be quantified by a Bayes factor. It is only when one has reasons for specifying a scale of effect that the level of evidence can be specified for no effect (that is, non-significance is not a reason for saying there is no effect). In almost all papers I read people declare absence of an effect while having no rational grounds for doing so. So we need to specify what scale of effect our theory predicts. Specifying what one’s theory predicts may not come naturally, but I show some ways of thinking about the problem. I think our science will be better for it!

Introduction to the formr survey framework in R <a href="https://formr.org/">formr</a>, <a href="https://osf.io/gu23h/">(slides)</a> <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>Formr is a free and open source survey framework which supports a broad range of study designs. Formr surveys have a responsive layout (i.e. they also work on phones and tablets) and the data can easily be shared via spreadsheets. Further, studies can be linked to the OSF. Because of the integration with R, formr allows researchers to use a familiar programming language to enable complex features.

Qualitative data – reaching the parts that statistics can’t? <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
An interactive seminar using data collected in an ethnography of homelessness (using participant observation, observation, and qualitative [walking] interviews). While originally used for an anthropological analysis, we can use this seminar to explore the place of such data in psychology (is there a place?) including the methods of data collection, different approaches to coding/analysis, writing up, and the reflexive researcher.

Take a picture, it’ll last longer: Practical and ethical considerations on using visual methods in qualitative research <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>For many people, taking and sharing photographs is an everyday behaviour, and is a way of sharing parts of your life (and your identity) with friends and family. This session discusses how research can utilise this everyday practice in a research setting, in order to shine a light on the elements of a participants’ life that may be inaccessible to traditional methods (such as surveys). In doing so, we explore the links between visual methods and ethnography, the use of visual methods in readdressing the power imbalance inherent in research, and some of the practical and ethical considerations of the method.</p>
This session will include two case studies from our research (children’s experience of neighbourhood demolition; men’s experience of food poverty), as well as participation from the audience.

Is Hypothesis Testing Overused in Psychology? <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>A central goal of many of the open-science reforms proposed in reaction to the replication crisis is to reduce false-positive results in the literature. Very often, they assume that research consists of confirmatory hypothesis tests and that ‘questionable research practices’ are ways in which researchers cut corners to present evidence in favour of hypotheses that may in fact be false. Two increasingly popular methods to prevent this from happening are preregistration and Registered Reports: Both require that authors state their hypotheses and analysis plan before conducting their study, which is supposed to prevent twisting the data to fit the narrative (e.g. p-hacking) or twisting the narrative to fit the data (hypothesising after results are known). In theory, this practice safeguards the validity of inferences drawn from hypothesis tests by removing any ‘wiggle room’ authors could exploit to produce spurious positive results. In practice, many psychologists seem to struggle to fit their research into this revised, now much more narrow framework of confirmatory hypothesis testing: Preregistration has been accused of stifling creativity, is described as difficult even by its proponents, and analyses of published preregistrations show that most do not sufficiently restrict the above-mentioned wiggle room.</p>
I want to argue that by making the very strict requirements of a confirmatory hypothesis test so explicit, preregistration and Registered Reports reveal that hypothesis testing may be the wrong tool for a substantial number of research questions in psychology. The conflation of exploratory and confirmatory research that psychologists have been used to may have stifled the development of a framework for high-quality exploratory research, which is the necessary basis for developing hypotheses in the first place. As such, resistance against preregistration and some of the growing pains the format is experiencing may simply be a consequence of it laying bare the misfit between research goals and the excessive focus on hypothesis testing in psychology. If this is true, psychologists may be well advised to shift this focus and work towards better literacy in the exploratory ground work that precedes confirmatory hypothesis tests.

Variance Constraints for Hierarchical Signal Detection Models <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Bayesian models typically place uninformative or weakly informative priors on parameters. Using a well-known data set on inductive and deductive reasoning, it is illustrated how incorporating variance constraints can help to estimate critical parameters and compare signal detection models with equal and unequal variance.

A gentle introduction to the Partial Information Decomposition <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>In many cases in neuroimaging or data analysis we evaluate a statistical dependence in many variables, and find effects in more than one. For example, we might find an effect between a presented stimulus and neural responses in different spatial regions, time periods or frequency bands. A natural question in such situations is to what extent is the statistical relationship in the two responses common, or overlapping, and to what extent is there a unique effect in one response that is not related to the other response. An information theoretic framework called the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) has been proposed to address these questions.</p>
<p>The first part of the session will be a gentle introduction to information theoretic quantification of statistical interactions, introducing co-information, redundancy, synergy and the basic theory of the PID, as well as introducing some applications (including, interactions between neural responses, interactions between multi-modal stimulus features in speech, interactions between neural responses and behaviour and predictive model comparison).</p>
The second part of the session will go into a bit more detail into the details of the implementation of the PID including the theory and computation of the Iccs redundancy measure, and more discussion of issues such a misinformation (negative unique information), applications etc. There will be a break between the two parts to give people the chance to opt-out of the more technical second part.

Jupyter notebooks for efficient research <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Coming from a Natural Language Processing engineer’s perspective, where research is embedded in my job requirements, I have found Jupyter Notebooks as a very useful tool for research. Like every other tool out there, it can have its benefits as well as it can make things go very wrong. I will start with a (very) brief introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and basic workflow. Most importantly, I want to open a discussion about how research can be done using Jupyter Notebooks. I will discuss how they are used to facilitate rapid research and what are the most common problems with using them. The second part of the talk will be focused on two of the biggest issues in research code - code quality and reproducibility. I will offer advice and processes that can be adopted, in order to improve the quality of the code and ultimately the reproducibility of the conducted experiments.

Network analysis as an alternative to conceptualize mental disorders <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
<p>[** NOTE: meeting takes place at 10am, a departure from the regular time **]</p>
In recent years, the network approach has been gaining popularity in the field of psychopathology as one of the alternatives to the traditional classification systems like the DSM. The network perspective conceptualises mental disorders as direct interactions between symptoms, rather than as a reflection of an underlying entity. The number of studies using this approach has grown rapidly in mental health. Thus, the aim of this talk is to introduce this new approach in psychopathology, know as network theory. The talk will summarize concepts and methodological issues associated to the study of mental problems from this novel approach. It will also show the current status of the network theory and modelling in psychopathology. The final objective is to exchange ideas regarding the theory methodology and limitations of Network Analysis.

Although it requires substantial time to set up, over the long run, the exams package makes creating and marking exams more efficient.

LexOPS: A Web App for Stimulus Generation in Psycholinguistics <a href="https://github.com/Jack-Tay/LexOPS">LexOPS github</a> <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
A common problem in designing Psychology experiments that use word stimuli is that they often require labour-intensive methods of stimulus generation, to ensure that specific prelexical, lexical, and semantic features are suitably controlled for. When this is done poorly, confounding variables can obscure the interpretation of results. This talk and demonstration introduce a new intuitive R Shiny App which integrates a wide range of features from multiple sets of norms, corpora, megastudies, and measures. The App allows the user to easily generate stimuli, fetch characteristics of existing stimuli, and identify suitably matched stimulus controls within desired constraints.

The Situated Assessment Method (SAM^2): A new approach to measuring, understanding, and predicting health behaviours <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Based on theories of situated cognition and embodiment in cognitive science, the Situated Assessment Method (SAM^2) offers a theoretically motivated approach for measuring health behaviours at both the group and individual levels. Rather than attempting to capture a health behaviour with general items that abstract over relevant situations (as in standard self-report instruments), SAM^2 assesses two situated dimensions. First, SAM^2 establishes the specific situations associated with an individual’s behaviour in a health domain. Second, SAM^2 samples features from the situated action cycle that attempt to predict the behaviour across situations. As a result, SAM^2 establishes overall measures of a health behaviour grounded directly in situational experience, along with features of the situated action cycle that predict the behaviour. In recent studies, we have found that SAM^2 does an excellent job of predicting health behaviours associated with habits, eating, stress, and trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). Using mixed effects models, SAM^2 typically explains 60 to 80% of the variance at the group level and more variance at the individual level, demonstrating large systematic individual differences. In addition, SAM^2 represents individual differences in an explicit manner that has potential for supporting individuals as they understand and work with a health behaviour. Issues associated with causality, explicit vs. implicit measures, and external validity are important to address.

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. In this tutorial, I’m going to walk you through the absolute basics of setting up a shiny app, starting with the example built into RStudio. I’m not going to explain yet how shiny apps are structured, the goal is to just get something up and running, and give you some familiarity with the layout of a fairly simple app. The tutorial will take place in a computer lab, so there is no need to bring a laptop, but if you do, please make sure you have installed R and RStudio before you arrive. You don’t need to have any other familiarity with R.

Mixed-effects modeling of temporal autocorrelation: Keep it minimal <a>(abstract)</a>
<div class="abstract">
Linear models assume the independence of residuals. This assumption is violated in datasets where there is temporal autocorrelation among the residuals. Recently, Baayen, Vasishth, Kliegl, and Bates (2017) presented evidence for autocorrelation in three psycholinguistic datasets, and showed how Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) can be used to model these autocorrelation patterns. However, there is currently little understanding of the impact of autocorrelation on model performance, and the extent to which GAMMs improve (or impair) inference. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we found that mixed-effects models perform well in the face of autocorrelation, except when autocorrelation is confounded with treatment variance. GAMMs did little to improve power, and in fact, the use of factor smooths dramatically impaired power for detecting effects of any between-subjects factors. These results suggest GAMMs are only needed in special cases.
